      "question": "Can utbe used fir the samsung galaxy j7 refine phone",
      "answer": "Just because a phone has a micro sd slot does not mean said phone will support ANYTHING you put in it... you have to look at the phones specs and see what the maximum size micro sd card that phone can support.\nFor example, the J7 can only support micro sd card size up to a maximum of 128 GB, any micro sd car larger than that capacity is too large for the J7 to support and it will not allow it.\nEvery phone (that supports micro SD cards that is, which these days is pretty much all Android-based phones) has certain specifications that list what the maximum sized micro SD card that phone is able to support, so you should always make sure to double check your phones specs before purchasing a micro SD card for it. It would really be a bummer to spend more money to purchase a large one just to find out that it's too large for your phone to be able to support... or end up buying a smaller one to find out your phone could have supported a much larger one and you could have had more of that oh so valuable space.\nHope this helps!",

      "question": "How many gb is this 128gb card reporting mine says 119 and has only read speed of 17mb/s",
      "answer": "It is supposed to. Storage devices consider 1GB=1000MB, 1M=1000KB, 1KB=1000B (powers of 10). Operating systems consider those to be in powers of 2 (1024 instead of 1000). So convert 128GB = 128000000000B using the base2 definition of GB/MB/KB: 128000000000B / (1024MB/GB) / (1024KB/MB) / (1024B/MB) = 119.2GB",
